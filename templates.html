            <p>Applying for SIV is a very lengthy process. There are five steps in the application process.
              However, the most important step is the first step, we recommend reading the the application
              instructions <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/SIVs/Afghan_SIV_Guidelines_and_DS157_Instructions_(April%202017).pdf">here</a> very carefully before applying.

            <p>When you read the application instructions, you will notice that beside your personal documents,
                there are three main documents that you need for your application package. Applicants usually 
                don't know how to prepare these documents. First of all, remember that there is no standard
                template for these document, as long as they meet the requirements explained in the application
