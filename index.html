       <h3>What is SIV?</h3>
        <p> SIV stands for Special Immigrant Visa. It is a type of US visa dedicated for those nationals of 
            Afghanistan and Iraq who worked with the US military and other projects of the US government in Iraq
            and Afghanistan. The SIV program for Iraqis started in 2008 for Afghans in 2009. Since then, thousands of
            Iraqis and Afghans with their families have migrated to the US via this program. It is worth mentioning that
            the program has very strict eligibility criteria and a very lengthy process. SIV applicants must prove that
            their lives are in danger becuase of their employment with or on behalf of the US government and they must
            go through several security screenings and paperworks. The application process normally takes from 2 to 
            several years. Some of the applicants that have been in contact with us through our Facebook page, have
            said that they have been waiting for more than 5 years but on average, the application process takes
            about 2.5 years</p>
